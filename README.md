This app is designed with the latest technologies to provide customers with a smooth and enjoyable experience.

The power of PostgresSQL was leveraged for efficient and secure database management, guaranteeing that booking information is stored safely and readily accessible whenever customers need it.

On the frontend, React, React Router, and React DOM is utilized to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. My goal was to provide customers with a visually appealing and intuitive platform that makes it easy to browse through our extensive selection of destinations and plan the perfect getaway. With the help of Tailwind CSS, I've crafted a modern and stylish design that enhances the overall user experience.
